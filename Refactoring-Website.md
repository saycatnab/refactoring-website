# Refactoring Agency's Website

## Description

This Project was made for me to take existing code from this marmeting agency's website, Horiseon and refactor it i.e. to improve it without changing what it does to make the marketing agency's website more accessible.
To do this, I have:
* included Semantic HTML elements which can be found throughout the source code.
* made sure the HTML elements and CSS properties follow a logical structure and best practises.
* given image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes.
* compiled heading attributes in sequential order
* given title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To observe how the website's code is more accessible, please check the repository link here https://github.com/saycatnab/refactoring-website or navigate to the agency's website (https://saycatnab.github.io/refactoring-website/) and right-click, click on inspect and observe the code there.
Although it hasn't made any observable changes on the website, the code is much more organized as seen t=in the source code.
